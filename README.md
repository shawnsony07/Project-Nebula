# Project-Nebula
The Exoplanet 3D Star Map Web Application is a tool that serves as an exoplanet and stars visualizer in 3D space. It is a technology made with Flask for the backend of the application and Three.js for 3D rendering, which uses the real-time exoplanetary data gained from NASA's Exoplanet Archive and star data from the Gaia database.
